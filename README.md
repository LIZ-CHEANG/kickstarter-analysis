# kickstarter-analysis
#Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to be able help Louise visualize how campaigns will perform by providing information on the outcomes of campaigns based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

#Analysis and Challenges

###Some of the challenges I encountered during the data set where being able to arrange the information so that it can represent the data in a clear and concise manner
 
 #Results
##Theater Outcomes by launch date
### Based on the finndings we can conclude that the number of successful outcomes is much greater than failed/canceled campaigns. We can also see that during the months of April 

##Outcomes based on Goals
 ### We can see that when we have a high goal the more likely it is not not be reached
 
##Limitations
###One of the limitations I can see is the findings are very generalized. we will not have same outcomes if we are to see this per country. Not every country will ahve the same number of succescess are the other. It could be that one country favors plays more than others.

##Other Graphs
###For the Outcomes based on goal we could use a stacked bar graph to compare the percenatge of the range of goal is succesful/failed/canceled
